&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you feel if you could fully use hundreds of GPUs alone, sleep at work, work at a standing desk and most importantly, discuss and share ideas freely in an office environment specially designed for brilliant innovative thinking? In addition, how would you feel if you are allowed to go to work and go home almost anytime you want at your convenience. Here we go. We aim to design and implement this kind of revolutionary working environment in Seoul, Korea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;As research and development, especially those regarding artificial intelligence, globalizes super-fast, research engineers would be better to respond quickly to new innovations coming from all over the world. To meet the demand, we decided to make our organization as flat as possible (horizontal structure) in order to remove hassles that slow down innovations in vertically-structured organizations (a lot of paperwork, many bosses ordering different things and infinitely more you can possible imagine).

&nbsp;&nbsp;While our organization somewhat resembles a start-up company, our compensation package does not. We provide the most competitive salaries in our business sector, the software industry. We can even afford AI superstars who deserve very high salaries, so no worries until you get to see your final numbers. Just try it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a brand new A.I research organization in the SK Group, one of the largest group of companies in Korea. We are looking for people who want to lead the AI R&amp;D trend by applying the state-of- art AI technologies to various industries and publishing new papers to the top AI/ML/CV/NLP venues. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;We need brilliant A.I researchers and engineers who have strong background knowledge in mathematics and computer science. People with REAL abilities are all welcomed, regardless of the universities they’ve graduated from, or the number of certifications they have. Below are some examples of what we think important for each job type:

### Strong Engineers
 - Highest level achievements in competitions such as IOI, ICPC, DEFCON, IPSC or TCO
 - Equal or more than 200 stars (accumulated) in Github

### Powerful Researchers
 - Those who published papers in top class conferences or journals such as NIPS, CVPR, AAAI, ICML, ICLR, EMNLP or KDD
 - Equal or more than 100 Google Scholar citations

### Brilliant Theorists
 - Highest level achievements in competitions such as IMO, Project Euler or IPhO

### AI Geeks
 - Highest level achievements in competitions such as ILSVRC, WMT or Kaggle

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people might ask, “Is it even possible to gather people satisfying one of the above conditions?”. The truth is, there are many of them here with us already! If you do not belong to the categories we’ve listed, but you are confident you are highly capable of doing AI stuffs so that you well deserve a position, it’s just fine. Just let us know your strong points and we will understand since we are ready to welcome everyone who is prepared to lead the future of AI!

&nbsp;&nbsp;We are awaiting for you to join us. If you are an AI rock star or you want to become the next one, please send your curriculum vitae (resume) to jazzsaxmafia@gmail.com . We are looking forward to meeting you!
